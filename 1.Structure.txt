STRUCTURE

SUMMARY:
=> HTML pages are text documents.
=> HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
=> Tags are often referred to as elements.
=> Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
=> Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
=> Attributes require a name and a value.
=> To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

HTML DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE OF PAGES:
=> The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets â€” these are called HTML elements.
=> Elements are usuallymade up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing taghas an extra forward slash in it.)
=> Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT THE CODE:
=> The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.
=> The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
=> </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
=> Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.
=> A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags.
=> Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading.
=> Here is another paragraph between opening <p> and closing </p> tags.
=> Another sub-heading inside <h2> and </h2> tags.
=> Another paragraph inside <p> and </p> tags.
=> The closing </body> tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.
=> The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.

A CLOSER LOOK AT TAGS: 

KEYPOINTS:
=> <p> Opening Tag
=> p is a Character.The characters in the brackets indicate the tag's purpose.For example, in the tags above the p stands for paragraph.
=> < LEFT-ANGLE BRACKET (LESS-THAN SIGN)
=> > RIGHT-ANGLE BRACKET(MORE-THAN SIGN)

=> </p> Closing Tag
=> / FORWARD SLASH
=> The terms "tag" and "element" are often used interchangeably.Strictly speaking, however, an element comprises the opening tag and the closing tag and any content that lies between them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATTRIBUTES TELL US MORE ABOUT ELEMENTS:
=> Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

=> <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>
=> lang is an "Attribute Name".
=> "en-us" is an "Attribute Value".

KEYPOINTS:
=> The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be written in lowercase.
=> The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes. Different attributes can have different values.
=> Here an attribute called lang is used to indicate the language used in this element. The value of this attribute on this page specifies it is in US English.
=> The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements, although a few attributes (such as lang) can appear on any element.
Most attribute values are either pre-defined or follow a stipulated format. We will look at the permitted values as we introduce each new attribute.
=> The value of the lang attribute is an abbreviated way of specifying which language is used inside the element that all browsers understand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BODY, HEAD & TITLE:
=> <body> You met the <body> element in the first example we created. Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
=> <head> Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element. This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a <title> element inside the <head> element.
=> <title> The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
